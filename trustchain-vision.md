# Draft title: "Trustchain: blockchain transactions for identity, trade, and legal registries".

-introduction
 * current 2nd generation stuff (bitcoin,ethereum)
 * next generation vision: scalability and distributed database paradigm
 
 architectural outline for BC3 vision
 
-future blockchain scenarios
 *ICO crash and ecosystem failure
 *chronic darknet and tax evasion currency
 *fancy Edifact,XML,json replacement
 *underhyped: new paradigm for identity and global trust
-Current and future distributed database models
 * cybercurrency versus blockchain database (.js)
 * yet another distributed database model (Hierarchical, relational,
NoSQL, graph-based,..)
 * new: permissionless, no servers, no central governance
 * new ownership model: nobody owns the blockchain-database
-Legal registries and asset transfers
-System Architecture
  Our BC3/Delft technology portfolio / stack / architecture consists now of:
  * self-sovereign identity system for people, organisations and objects
  * identity governance, claim verification and selective attribute revealing
  * biometric-based authentication of people and legal representatives
  * elastic persistent storage of data, metadata, and versioning services
  * transitive trust and real-time incremental reputations for any entity
  * TrustChain: transaction storage fabric and self-governance
  * legal binding, signatures, notifications, e-invoices
  * real-time money transfer, clearing, and settlement
  * decentral blockchain-regulated markets
-TrustChain experiments
-Land registration application
-Global Mortgage Finance market application
