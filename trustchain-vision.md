# Draft title: "Trustchain: blockchain transactions for identity, trade, and legal registries".

Authors: try get RvIG, KvK, Kadaster on board first. Then BC3 figurehead, DNB, even StartupDelta?

_abstract_
_We outline a trust-based blockchain architecture, present implementation results, and show the possible usage, for instance, land ownership transfer. In August 2007 we launched a primitive fully distributed ledger. Based our ledger deployment experience of the past decade we present a global architecture of a third generation blockchain fabric. This technology stack covers the complete range from low-level hardware with our Physical unclonable function prototypes towars our blockchain-regulated decentral marketplace. _

-introduction
 * current 2nd generation stuff (bitcoin,ethereum)
 * next generation vision: scalability and distributed database paradigm
 
 architectural outline for BC3 vision
 
-future blockchain scenarios
 *ICO crash and ecosystem failure
 *chronic darknet and tax evasion currency
 *fancy Edifact,XML,json replacement
 *underhyped: new paradigm for identity and global trust
-Current and future distributed database models
 * cybercurrency versus blockchain database (.js)
 * yet another distributed database model (Hierarchical, relational,
NoSQL, graph-based,..)
 * new: permissionless, no servers, no central governance
 * new ownership model: nobody owns the blockchain-database
-Legal registries and asset transfers
-System Architecture
  Our BC3/Delft technology portfolio / stack / architecture consists now of:
  * PUF (REF: Modeling SRAM start-up behavior for physical unclonable functions)
  * self-sovereign identity system for people, organisations and objects
  * identity governance, claim verification and selective attribute revealing
  * biometric-based authentication of people and legal representatives
  * elastic persistent storage of data, metadata, and versioning services
  * transitive trust and real-time incremental reputations for any entity
  * TrustChain: transaction storage fabric and self-governance
  * Business primitives: legally binding identification, authentication, signatures, irrifutable notifications, business transactions, contracts, e-invoicing, e-factoring, and IFTTT logic.
  * real-time IBAN/BIC money transfer, conditional payments, currency conversion, clearing, and settlement
  * decentral blockchain-regulated markets
