# Draft title: "Trustchain: blockchain transactions for identity, trade, and legal registries".

Authors: Delft University of Technology as initiator, invite RvIG, Chamber of Commerce, Land Registry Agency to possibly join. With a readable draft might aim to include BC3 figurehead, DNB/AFM, banks, even StartupDelta?

#### very tight deadlines
- July 10: first readable draft, distributed to partners
- July 16: partner feedback processed and alignment completed
- July 22: Scientific Journal submission!

_abstract_
_We present a blueprint to create the worlds first programmable economy with blockchain technology as an organisational paradigm, supported by key players within an existing economy. 
Current scientific work on economic organisation is often focussed on helping society decide on the optimal allocation of our limited resources.
We propose to re-organise parts of the global economy by using the following three rules: replace central decision making with decentral supervision {e.g. in Dutch 'horizontaal toezicht'}, and digital ostracism for rule breaking economic actors.
We propose a new decision making doctrine: uncompromising transparency, full openness, and radically decentralised. 
We believe our blueprint to take many years of effort, but still viable, realistic, and based on technology which is already partly implemented._

_Our programmable economy blueprint consists of a natively-digital economic system with self-governance to avoid any single-point-of-failure, security grounded upon the laws of physics (avoiding software), radical transparency, publically verifiable claims on economic actors within the blockchain, reputation tracking for each economic actor, elaborate mechanisms to establish trust between strangers, legally frinctionless enforcable contracts, and facilitate a single blockchain-regulated digital marketplace for generic economic value exchange and any-asset trading.
Digital ostracism or ecosystem banning is our cardinal mechanism to incentivise each participant to contribute towards a global desirable outcome and protect against freeriding, fraud, and abuse._

_We outline a trust-based blockchain architecture, present partial implementation results, and show the possible usage, for instance, land ownership transfer. The scope of our proposal is broad, it should be usable across sectors and possibly replace paper-based procedures. In August 2007 we launched a primitive fully distributed ledger. Based our ledger deployment experience of the past decade we present a global architecture of a third generation blockchain fabric. This technology stack covers the complete range from low-level hardware with our Physical unclonable function prototypes towars our blockchain-regulated decentral marketplace._


### introduction
 - current 2nd generation stuff (bitcoin,ethereum)
 - next generation vision: scalability and distributed database paradigm
 
 architectural outline for BC3 vision.
 Existing proposals for Bitcoin and Ethereum aim to build an entire socio-economic ecosystem from cratch. So far they failed.
 
### future blockchain scenarios
- ICO crash and ecosystem failure
- chronic darknet and tax evasion currency
- fancy Edifact,XML,json replacement
- underhyped: new paradigm for identity and global trust
 
 The National Bank stated that if the blockchain is the answer what is the questions.
 
### Current and future distributed database models

- cybercurrency versus blockchain database (.js)
- yet another distributed database model (Hierarchical, relational,
NoSQL, graph-based,..)
- new: permissionless, no servers, no central governance
- new ownership model: nobody owns the blockchain-database

### Legal registries and asset transfers

To be determined: offline identificatie van mensen die bepaalde rechtspersonen mogen representeren.
Openbaar electronisch handtekeningen register; waarin elke bedrijf kan registreren welke
natuurlijke personen bepaalde authorisaties of verantwoordelijkheden dragen.
Bijvoorbeeld Onderneming X verklaart dat persoon Y tekenbevoegd is voor 
financiele verplichtingen tot bedrag Z.

### TrustChain technology stack
  Our BC3/Delft technology portfolio / stack / architecture consists now of:
- PUF (REF: Modeling SRAM start-up behavior for physical unclonable functions)
- self-sovereign identity system for people, organisations and objects
- identity governance, claim verification and selective attribute revealing
- biometric-based authentication of people and legal representatives
- elastic persistent storage of data, metadata, and versioning services
- transitive trust and real-time incremental reputations for any entity
- TrustChain: transaction storage fabric and self-governance
- Business primitives: legally binding identification, authentication, signatures, irrifutable notifications, business transactions, contracts, e-invoicing, e-factoring, and IFTTT logic.
- real-time IBAN/BIC money transfer, conditional payments, currency conversion, clearing, and settlement
- decentral blockchain-regulated markets
  
  We present a feasible system architecture for efficient, fast, and secure usage of blockchain technology in existing businesses.
  
### TrustChain experiments

### Land registration application

### Global Mortgage Finance market application
